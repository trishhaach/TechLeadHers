# TechLeadHers

TechLeadHers is a program organized by Aaviyanta Foundation, held in KMC Ward-17. This repository contains the code I practiced during the 10-day bootcamp, where I learned MERN stack development.

## Introduction

This repository showcases exercises completed as part of the TechLeadHers bootcamp. The focus was on learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to build full-stack web applications.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git

## Conclusion

Thank you for visiting the TechLeadHers repository. This bootcamp has provided a solid foundation in MERN stack development, and the excercised here reflect the skills and knowledge gained over the 10 days.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
